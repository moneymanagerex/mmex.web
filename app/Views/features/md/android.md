The Android version of MoneyManagerEx allows you to manage your expenses in full mobility, to verify the balance of your bank accounts, term accounts, stocks.

It allows you to add new payees, new categories and add and/or modify transactions. Some of the reports offered in the desktop version are available to your Android tablet/smartphone. The Android app MoneyManagerEx daily notifies you about the overdue repeating transactions.

The Android app natively supports synchronization with Dropbox; this allows you to be up to date with your account situation, to add/update/modify the transactions, to manage categories, payees and repeating transactions... anything always from your mobile device. The database can be shared among your family, and everybody among then can update it with the newest expenses. For the ones among them who are not using Dropbox, but Drive, Box.net and more, MoneyManagerEx still works. The only thing you have to do is synchronize the database on the mobile device with the correct application and the game is done!
